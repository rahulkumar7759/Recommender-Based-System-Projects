# Recommender-Based-System-Projects

# Have you ever seen movies or web series on online streaming platforms? Once you watch one or two of them, you will notice that apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime recommend new web series and movies. It is because these apps render machine learning models that try to understand the customerâ€™s taste. Modern e-commerce sites like Flipkart, Amazon, Alibaba, etc., also have the same feature. Recommendation engines are popular in media, entertainment, and shopping. All modern apps come with a recommendation engine that suggests users for more engagement.

# You can use libraries like recommenderlab for testing and developing the recommendation models for your ML project. Apart from that, libraries like ggplot, reshape2, data.table will complement your machine learning project. Datasets like Google Local, Amazon product reviews, MovieLens, Goodreads, NES, Librarything are preferable for creating recommendation engines using machine learning models. They have a well-researched collection of data such as ratings, reviews, timestamps, price, category information, customer likes, and dislikes.
